                        My name is Jace Webster, and I am a PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis,
                        in their Human and Statistical Genetics program. Before that, I was an undergraduate
                        at BYU in Provo, Utah, where I studied Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology. Besides
                        being a bit of a science nerd, I also enjoy playing soccer, reading, and spending time
                        with my family.
                        <br><br>
                        This portfolio is a side project I have been developing, as a way to help me work on
                        building new skills that aren't directly related to my formal academic training. While
                        I get to do a fair amount of data crunching as a student in a statistical genetics
                        program, genetics students don't often get to take classes in things like web development,
                        web scraping, or natural language processing. So, when I find myself with a little spare
                        time, I like to create projects designed to help me broaden my skillset. By design, these
                        projects aren't necessarily exhaustive, but instead are meant to give me opportunities to
                        try things I might not get to work on otherwise. While these projects are not meant to be
                        tutorials, I do attempt to generally explain some of the logic and code behind them.
                        <br><br>
                        This portfolio, and the projects in it, are still growing, but feel free to check it out
                        to see what's been done so far. If you're interested in seeing more of the code for this
                        portfolio, you can check out the GitHub repo for it by clicking <a href="https://github.com/jbwebster/Data-Science-Portfolio"> here</a>. If you want to see what else
